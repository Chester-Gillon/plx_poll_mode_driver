MEX completed successfully.

After Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express was attached to the MATLAB process the Modules view didn't show yprime.mexw64
and breakpoints on mexFunction and yprime weren't hit.

Process Explorer was showing yprime.mexw64 in the DLLs loaded by MATLAB.

Re-compiling the mex file using the -g option didn't change the behaviour.

Running cv2pdb.exe yprime.mexw64 changed the yprime.mexw64 file and created a yprime.pdb file:

With Eclipse Oxygen 4.7.3a was able to create a "C/C++ Attach to Application" debug configuration.
With a function breakpoint set on yprime was able to attach to the MATLAB process, and when called yprime
from the MATLAB command prompt then stopped at the breakpoint with the callstack:
yprime() at yprime.c:51 0x7fec157d38a0	
mexFunction() at yprime.c:117 0x7fec157d3cec

Mfh_file::dispatch_fh() at 0x7fecc3dad16e	

With Eclipse attached to the MATLAB process sometimes stops at a SIGSEGV and then have to resume.
I think this is due to Java sometimes generating and handling exceptions.
https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/debugging-on-linux-platforms.html recommends starting MATLAB without
the Java Virtual Machine to debug mex files under Linux, but not sure what that does in the Matlab applications makes use
of any functions which built upon Java.


== Failed attempt to use Eclipse Oxygen to attach to MATLAB under Windows 10 ==

Downloaded the following to Windows 10 to get Eclipse Oxygen as already used under Linux:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/oxygen/3a/eclipse-cpp-oxygen-3a-win32-x86_64.zip

A Java 8 or newer JRE/JDK is required to run all Oxygen packages based on Eclipse 4.7, including running the Installer.
The eclipse.ini shows this requires a 64-bit JVM.

There is a Windows Offline (64-bit) jre-8u281-windows-x64.exe installer linked from
https://java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp?host=java.com&locale=en-GB

However, that requires a license from Oralce for non-commercial development.

MATLAB R2018b already comes with a 64-bit JVM:
C:\>"c:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\sys\java\jre\win64\jre\bin\java.exe" -version
java version "1.8.0_152"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.152-b16, mixed mode)

Adding c:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\sys\java\jre\win64\jre\bin to path allowed Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a) to start.

Attempted to create a "C/C++ Attach to Application" in debug configuration in Eclipse which needed gdb.

Set the PATH to find the gdb 7.11.1 in C:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\bin
but gdb termined before could select the process to attach to, which happened even if C/C++ application was blank.

Using Process Monitor found gdb.exe was spawning gdborig.exe which think in for Phyton support for formatting output.

Tried setting the following, as suggested by https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/discussion/723798/thread/4a8a9ed5/ 
to allow gdborig.exe to work:
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\opt\bin
set PYTHONHOME=C:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\opt
set PYTHONPATH=C:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\share\gcc-6.3.0\python;c:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\opt\lib\python2.7\lib-dynload;c:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\opt\lib\python2.7\site-packages;c:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2018b\3P.instrset\mingw_w64.instrset\opt\lib\python2.7

Which allowed gdborig -version to work from a command shell but still crashed when attempted to use "Attach to process".

The gddorig.exe crash resulted in an Windows Error report but not obvious what the issue was.

The crash with the mingw CGB installed with MATLAB was repeated on a different Windows 10 PC with MATLAB R2020b.


== Successful use of Eclipse Oxygen with GDB 7.5.50 ==

Looked for pre-compiled GDB versions for Windows from other sources.
https://gnutoolchains.com/mingw64/ has a link to https://sysprogs.com/getfile/514/mingw64-gcc9.1.0.exe
which has a pre-built GDB 8.3 but Windows Smart screen blocked.

https://sysprogs.com/getfile/507/mingw64-gcc8.1.0.exe was also blocked by Windows Smart screen.

https://sysprogs.com/getfile/31/mingw64-gcc4.7.1.exe was allowed, which contains GDB 7.5.50

Using the following was able to successfully create aa "C/C++ Attach to Application" debug configuration
which could attach to MATLAB, set a breakpoint on mexFunction and debug the yprime mex example:
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\sys\java\jre\win64\jre\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\SysGCC\MinGW64\bin
C:\eclipse\eclipse-cpp-oxygen-3a-win32-x86_64\eclipse\eclipse.exe

Note when the list of processes was displayed in Eclipse, MATLAB wasn't listed by name and had to find the PID from
Windows task manager to determine the process to attach to.

And repeated on a different Windows 10 PC with MATLAB 2020b:
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2020b\sys\java\jre\win64\jre\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\SysGCC\MinGW64\bin
C:\eclipse\eclipse-cpp-oxygen-3a-win32-x86_64\eclipse\eclipse.exe


https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/241291-how-to-debug-mex-file-compiled-with-mingw64-and-g-flags
suggests a different GDB version could be used
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/GDB/ has downloads with GDB.

Haven't tried those versions of GDB.


== Successful use of Visual Studio to debug mex files compiled with MinGW64 6.3.0 ==

The compile_mex.m function is used to compile MEX file with the MinGW64 6.3.0 installed as an add-on with MATLAB 2021a,
and then run the cv2pdb utility to generate the .PDB file with the debug information understood by Visual Studio.

The multi_platform_test.c source file also demonstrates using POSIX functions to allow common source for
Windows and Linux by use of:
- clock_getres()
- clock_gettime()
- opendir()
- readdir()

The only platform specific conditional compilation is to use GetFullPathName() or realpath(), since
realpath() isn't a POSIX function.

For debugging used either:
- Visual Studio 2010 Express
- Visual Studio Comumnity 2019

One difference between the Visual Studio versions is that only Visual Studio 2019 hits Function Breakpoints;
in Visual Studio 2010 attempting to get a function breakpoint in a MEX file results in Visual Studio reporting
that the function can't be found.

Setting a breakpoint in a source file works in both versions of Visual Studio.

A difference between MATLAB versions is the behaviour of if Visual Studio can debug the MEX file if the MEX file
is already loaded when Visual Studio when attach to the MATLAB process.

The following MATLAB versions allow Visual Studio 2010 Express or Visual Studio Community 2019 to debug if the MEX file
is already loaded when attach to MATLAB:
- R2016b, R2017a, R2017b

For the following MATLAB versions if the MEX file is already loaded when attach to MATLAB then are unable to debug
the MEX file; no breakpoints are hit any for unknown reasons the *.mexw64 file is *not* listed in the loaded list
of modules by Visual Studio. In this situation, using clear mex and then re-running the mex file which is loaded
then allows Visual Studio 2010 Express or Visual Studio Community 2019 to debug the MEX file:
- R2018a, R2018b, R2021a
